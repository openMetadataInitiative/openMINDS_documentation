   :description: The coordinate space of Swanson’s ‘Brain Maps: Structure of the Rat Brain’ uses Bregma as its origin. The coordinates stated under ‘axesOrigin’ are the coordinates of the origin in the physical coordinate system of the rat brain. The coordinates, AP = 8.11 mm, DV = 12 mm and ML = 0 mm, were obtained by combining the information provided in the physical book and the pdf version of the 3rd edition of Brain Maps: (1) "In the physical coordinate system, the z axis begins (= 0) at the rostral tip of the olfactory bulb, the y axis begins along an imaginary line that corresponds approximately to a surface that the extracted brain is lying upon, and the x axis begins at the midline." (quoted from chapter [‘B. Coordinate Systems: Stereotaxic Surgery and Databases’ of the 3rd edition of Brain Maps (pdf version from Swanson’s homepage)](http://larrywswanson.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/2-Atlas-prep-BrainMaps3-20041.pdf)). (2) "The rostrocaudal coordinate is given in parentheses after the corresponding physical coordinates, and the other two (dorsoventral and mediolateral) can be obtained with the transparent overlay provided in Appendix B." (quoted from chapter ‘D. How to Use this Atlas’ of the 3rd edition of Brain Maps, p. 15; ISBN: 0-126-10582-0). Based on Figure 4 from chapter [‘A. Histology and Map Production’ of the 3rd edition of Brain Maps (pdf version from Swanson’s homepage)](http://larrywswanson.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/2-Atlas-prep-BrainMaps3-20041.pdf)), the coordinate system is oriented towards the right since the rat’s right hemisphere has been used to draw the atlas. Thus, giving Swanson’s coordinate system RIA orientation (X, Y, Z axes are oriented towards right, inferior and anterior, respectively). Note: More detailed descriptions were provided in the 3rd edition of the atlas (digital and book combined) compared to the 1st edition, but both describe the exact same coordinate system.
